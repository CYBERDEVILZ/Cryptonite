## Fully functional ransomware that uses minimum resources to give maximum output

## TASK LIST
- [x] Encrypt all files except system specific ones
- [x] Encrytion must only be decrypted with a special key
- [x] Send the credentials of the victim to the attacker via secure tunnel, preferably NGROK
- [x] Pop up box should appear after encryption asking for ransom
- [x] Create a server to retrieve information sent by the victim
- [x] Add custom extension to encrypted files
- [ ] Create Windows Defender bypass script

# LEARN TO USE CRYPTONITE   
Cryptonite was developed with a motive of achieving maximum output with minimum efforts. Anyone can learn to use Cryptonite. The below steps will guide you to use Cryptonite properly:-

## 1. SETTING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME

The following setups need to be done if you are using Cryptonite for the first time.

### Create an NGROK account

* Visit [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)
* Signup for an account. If you can spare some money, then buy the premium version. Else, the free version will suffice.
* Login to [NGROK](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/login)
* Download the suitable release of NGROK for your operating system.

* Unzip and install NGROK.
  * For Linux / MAC users, unzip the folder via terminal:-   
  
        unzip /path/to/ngrok.zip
  * For Windows users, just unzip the folder and run the exe file   
* Authenticate your NGROK:-   
  * Copy your AUTH TOKEN from [NGROK SETUP PAGE](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
  * For windows users, open cmd and type (replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE` with your authtoken):-   
     
        ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
  * For Linux / MAC users, open terminal and type (replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE` with your authtoken):-   
     
        ./ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE

### Install the Python requirements for Cryptonite

    pip install -r "requirements.txt"  

## 2. FIRING UP THE SERVER!
Run the Server.py file before you send the ransomware to victims. Make sure that the Server runs all the time.
We will be running the Server on port 8000 of our localhost. Hence we need to perform port forwarding using NGROK to receive the credentials of our victims sent by our Ransomware. That will be our next step.

## 3. PORT FORWARDING USING NGROK

* Run NGROK on port 8000:-   
     

[Starting ngrok on 8000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55954313/124347475-a6b72d80-dc02-11eb-9d85-d8e5d0a79f08.mp4)


* Copy the url and add the link [here](https://github.com/CYBERDEVILZ/Cryptonite/blob/89199d0fb04eb682ecd22417bf1de9f0a60e4e69/Cryptonite.py#L17). 
* DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL OR ELSE THE PORT FORWARDING WILL STOP

## 4. FILLING UP THE DETAILS

* Open Cryptonite.py and edit these lines:-   
  * [Bitcoin Amount](https://github.com/CYBERDEVILZ/Cryptonite/blob/89199d0fb04eb682ecd22417bf1de9f0a60e4e69/Cryptonite.py#L18)
  * [Bitcoin Wallet](https://github.com/CYBERDEVILZ/Cryptonite/blob/89199d0fb04eb682ecd22417bf1de9f0a60e4e69/Cryptonite.py#L19)
  * [Email](https://github.com/CYBERDEVILZ/Cryptonite/blob/89199d0fb04eb682ecd22417bf1de9f0a60e4e69/Cryptonite.py#L20)
  
* Save Cryptonite.py

## 5. THAT'S IT.

Now we need to create an executable of this file and send it to the victim. This part is still under development. I will release the video tutorial SOON!
